# Dream-Home

Group Project submitted by Theresa Maria Seehofer and Julian Albrecht for the "7,789 | 8,789: Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages" course in the fall semester 2020 at the University of St. Gallen.

Our project is divided into three files.

Please read the introduction (PDF) file. The PDF file gives an overview about the projects and explains all parts in further detail.

Please also download the HTML file which shows the code with the respective output.
Moreover, it includes comments and interpretations of the code and the output.

The R file contains the raw code with fewer comments to keep it short and simple.
It can be used to test the features of the program. We strongly recommend to use RStudio to test them.
